# WasabiDoc

[Wasabi](https://wasabiwallet.io) is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop. It implements trustless coin shuffling: [Schnorrian CoinJoin](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/).

However, "[anonymity loves company](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/usability:weis2006.pdf)", the more participants there are, the better your privacy is, and the faster the coin join rounds are. Whether you are looking for state of the art operational security or you are philosophically aligned with the principles of freedom and privacy, now it is YOUR time to contribute. Fire up your Wasabi and help us to bootstrap the system!

This is the open source documentation repository of Wasabi Wallet, here you will find information about the nuances of privacy in Bitcoin, how Wasabi solves these difficult problems, and how you can use these tools to defend yourself. If you have a question that is not yet covered, please [open an issue](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/issues). If you have a good answer to a question, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/pulls).
