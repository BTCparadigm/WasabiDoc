## Coins

A coin is an unspent transaction output, a chunk of bitcoin which can be send in a future transaction.
In the Wasabi wallet `Send` tab, you see a list of all the coins you can spend because you have the private keys.
You can get a coin by first [receiving](/using-wasabi/Receive.md) them from someone else, for example by earning them or buying them for fiat currency.
You can spend one or more whole coins by selecting it in the `Send` tab, if your payment amount is below the value of the selected coins, then you will receive a [change coin](/using-wasabi/Change.md) back.
