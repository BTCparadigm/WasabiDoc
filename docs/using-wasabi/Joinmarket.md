## Introduction and History

[Joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver) is a CoinJoin protocol implemented in a wallet software which requires Bitcoin Core as backend.
Its novel innovation is to introducde incentive structures to encourage users mixing their coins.
One market taker can pay market makers to create a tailor made CoinJoin.
The software consists of several python scripts, has a graphical user interface, and utilizes IRC communication channels.
The initial v0.1.0 release was in December 2015 by [Chris Belcher](https://github.com/chris-belcher), and since then it has gathered steady support by several contributors, most notably [Adam Gibson](https://github.com/AdamISZ).
Joinmarket is an integral part of the Bitcoin privacy infrastructure, and the research and implementation by the contributors is invaluable.

Joinmarket is well [documentated](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/tree/master/docs) in regards for [installation](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md), usage of the [command line interface](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md) and [graphical user interface](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/JOINMARKET-QT-GUIDE.md).
