## Generating addresses step-by-step

1. Start Wasabi and open the wallet that you want to receive coins into.
2. Go to the `Receive` tab.
3. Specify a label of the entities who know about this address.
4. Click on `Generate Address` and it is automatically copied to your clipboard.
5. Optionally change the label in the right click menu if new entities learn about the address.
