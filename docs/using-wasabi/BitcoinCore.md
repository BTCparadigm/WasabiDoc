## The importance of running a full node

When running a Bitcoin full node, you define the precise monetary rules that you voluntarily agree on, nobody else forces this choice upon you.
Thus any sovereign individual who wants to claim financial independence must run a full node.
Once your own rules are firmly established, your software discovers other nodes in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network which adhere to the exact same set of rules.
These peers send you transactions and blocks which are valid according to their set of rules, and you verify for your self if they are also correct for you.
If one of the proposed transactions breaks your own rules, then you mark it as invalid, disconnect from and ban the node who send you the malicious transaction.

:::tip Claim your monetary sovereignty
With your full node you define, verify and enforce the rules of your sound money Bitcoin.
:::

Only when running your own node do you verify if the money you receive is actually valid bitcoin.
You do not trust on an external third party, and thus you also do not leak any sensitive financial information to them.
