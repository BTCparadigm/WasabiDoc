- You can activate LWM from Settings or by clicking on your wallet balance. 
- In LWM the wallet is still usable, which means input field information isn't hidden.  
- LWM only masks the surface. This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in LWM mode, for example like clicking on an expander, LWM won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen here: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234
