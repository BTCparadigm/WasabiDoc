# Contribution Game

[[toc]]

For some occasions there is a **Wasabi contribution game**, where the zkSNACKs company is distributing a bounty among contributors of the Wasabi repository in proportion to their contributions.

## Contribution game of July 2019

The first contribution game was in between the 25th of June and the 25th of July in 2019.
Anyone could participate and the metric of success was the numbers of lines added and removed to the code base in pull requests that were ultimately merged.
The total bounty was `1 bitcoin`, that ended up being distributed to 15 contributors, see the full results [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2016).
There were special boni for critical bugs discovered, as well as for the creation of this documentation.
Over all this was a great success, as several new peers started to contribute to Wasabi, specifically [@Yahiheb](https://github.com/yahiheb) and [@JMacato](https://github.com/jmacato) who stuck around for the long term.

## Monthly contribution game for the documentation

Having a well educated user base is essential for any complex software such as Wasabi.
In order to create and maintain this top notch documentation, there is an ongoing contribution game for any supporter of this archive of knowledge.
The metric of success is a combination of number of pull requests, lines added and removed, and effort in review of the changes.
The bounty of `1000 US Dollars` worth of bitcoin is paid out every month on the 25th.
The depth, quality and continuous maintenance of this documentation is proof of the success of this contribution game!
