# Contribution Game

[[toc]]

For some occasions there is a **Wasabi Contribution Game**, where the zkSNACKs company is distributing a bounty among contributors of the Wasabi repository in proportion to their contributions.

## Contribution Game of July 2019

The first contribution game was in between the 25th of June and the 25th of July in 2019.
Anyone could participate and the metric of success was the numbers of lines added and removed to the code base in pull requests that were ultimately merged.
The total bounty was `1 bitcoin`, that ended up being distributed to 15 contributors, see the full results [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2016).
There were special boni for critical bugs discovered, as well as for the creation of this documentation.
Over all this was a great success, as several new peers started to contribute to Wasabi, specifically [@Yahiheb](https://github.com/yahiheb) and [@JMacato](https://github.com/jmacato) who stuck around for the long term.
