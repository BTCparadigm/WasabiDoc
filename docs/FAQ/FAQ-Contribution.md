### How can I report a bug?
Code is speech, and can never be perfect.
Thus it is expected that there are many known and unknown bugs, quirks and issues in Wasabi.
Such a complex software requires constant and rigorous review by the developers and users, this is the responsibility of everyone working with Wasabi.

When you stumble upon an issue that needs fixing, please first check the open [issues](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pulls) if there is already someone working on it.
If yes, then you can comment your situation and bug report under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and give a detailed report on the problem.
It is especially helpful when You provide a step by step guide on how to reproduce what You have found.
There is constantly a lot of work done to the code base, thus it's good to know which version of Wasabi, and what operating system you are using.
In some cases it might be useful to see Your logs, though please consider your privacy and encrypt this data properly in direct communication with the developers.

:::warning
When you have found a critical bug that puts users at serious harm, please take great care with responsible disclosure!
Securely encrypt the detailed report to Ádám Ficsor's PGP key [21D7 CA45 565D BCCE BE45 115D B4B7 2266 C47E 075E](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/PGP.txt) and send it to [adam.ficsor73@gmail.com](mailto:adam.ficsor73@gmail.com).

### How can I request a feature?
Wasabi is a quite beautiful piece of software already.
Yet there are also 1001 things that could be just a little better, or even quite substantially superior.
The beauty and bain of libre and open source software is that it is never complete, there is always more work to be done.

Regardless if You are a new user of Wasabi, or a veteran black belt Wasabika, any suggestions on how to improve are desperately needed and very welcome.
Please first check the existing [issues](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pulls) if some one has the same feature request as You.
If yes, then You can comment your desired improvement under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=feature-request.md) and give a detailed request.
It makes sense to first explain the problem You have in the incumbent version of Wasabi, this is the place to express Your frustrations and annoyances.
Then describe the solution that You have envisioned, with all the nuances and details of how this would fix Your problem.
To flesh our Your argument, please consider alternatives and different approaches to this feature request.
