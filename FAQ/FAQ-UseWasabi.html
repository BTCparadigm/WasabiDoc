Go to the <code>Wallet Manager</code> tab and the <code>Generate Wallet</code> menu.
As with everything in Wasabi, you are required to label this new wallet. Make sure that you are precise so that you know what this is for later.
The password is used to encrypt the private key on the computer and on the backup.
<strong>Careful!!</strong> <strong>Without knowledge of the password, you CANNOT spend your bitcoin!!</strong>
Make sure that you properly back up and write down this password.
Please also read and agree to the terms and conditions, the privacy policy and the legal issues.
Now you can continue with clicking <code>Generate</code>.</p> <p><img src="/WalletManagerGenerateWallet.png" alt=""></p> <p>Now you will see the 12 recovery words, this is the mnemonic seed that you can use to backup and recover your wallet.
Make sure, and triple check, that you have done a proper backup of BOTH the password AND the mnemonic.
When you only have the recovery words, but not the password, then you will NOT be able to recover your wallet.
In order to protect your paper backup, consider storing the password and recovery words in two different locations.
You have successfully setup your wallet when you click <code>I wrote down my Recovery Words!</code></p> <p><img src="/WalletManagerRecoveryWords.png" alt=""></p></details><details id="what-password-should-i-use"><summary><a href="#what-password-should-i-use" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What password should I use?</summary> <p>The password you set is used to encrypt the mnemonic recovery words, and the private keys stored on the computer.
This is the password that will unlock your bitcoin to anyone who has access to the backup or computer.
You will need to type in the password before you can spend from Wasabi wallet.
So if your backup gets compromised, this password is the only thing protecting your precious sats.</p> <div class="custom-block danger"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>It is <strong>VERY</strong> important to use a random and long password.</p></div> <p>Since it is very difficult for humans to generate true randomness, it is good to use a tool to help find a strong password.

If you want to also secure your address labels, the anonset and additional metadata, then you can do a digital backup.
Simply copy the <code>.walletwasabi/client/WalletBackups</code> folder with the <code>wallet.json</code> files onto suitable hardware, for example an encrypted USB stick.
Note that this file has the encrypted private keys, meaning that you only need the password to spend the bitcoin.
This also contains the unencrypted extended public keys and address labels, meaning that it completely links all the coins, both pre and post mix, with clear proof.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>The wallet backup is sensitive, in terms of privacy, but not critical in terms of loss of funds.

This is used to encrypt the private key on your computer, which has an insecure operating system and is connected to the internet.
Every time you want to spend your coins from Wasabi, you MUST provide this password.
Also, the same password is used to encrypt the mnemonic recovery words that you must backup in the next step of wallet creation.

If not, then the filter is stored for later reference and for syncing new wallets.
If yes, then the wallet connects to a random Bitcoin peer-to-peer full node to request this entire block.
Your wallet does not communicate with the Wasabi server to download the block, because there's no need to trust it.
For every block download, Wasabi establishes a new and unique tor identity, meaning that it is not easy to link that it is the same entity downloading all these blocks.
The P2P node that serves you the block does not know if you are a regular Bitcoin full node, or a Wasabi light client node.
You are yet another peer in the network.</p> <p>It is important to note that although the privacy is as good as with a full node, you do not verify that the coins are actually valid.
In order to do this, you must run a full node and verify the entire timechain.
With the block filters, you trust that the Wasabi server gives you the correct filters, and does not withhold any of them.
You also do not have proof that the block you download from a P2P node is actually in the valid chain, but you can verify the proof of work in the block header.</p></details><details id="how-does-wasabi-download-a-relevant-block"><summary><a href="#how-does-wasabi-download-a-relevant-block" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How does Wasabi download a relevant block?</summary> <p>Wasabi uses BIP 158 block filter to find out if a specific block contains a transaction of a specific wallet.

When you use a new address for every coin, then it becomes much much more difficult to find out that these coins are from you.
However, when you use the same address for every coin, then everyone knows that all coins can be spent by one individual who has the private key - you!
Thus, when someone finds out that you have that address, maybe you published it in your social media profile for donations, or you send a coin to another peer who knows you, then he knows also how many bitcoin you have in that same address.
Take good care to whom you tell your addresses, and every time, tell someone a different address.</p> <p>Because you have all the private keys, for all these addresses, you can produce a valid signature for any of them.
So you can prove that these are your bitcoin, without relying on reputation that you have any other coins.

E.g., Wasabi will not generate address <code>m/84'/0'/0'/0/21</code> with label: &quot;address n. 22&quot;, instead it'll regenerate one between <code>m/84'/0'/0'/0/0</code> and <code>m/84'/0'/0'/0/20</code> and will overwrite previous label to &quot;address n. 22&quot;.</p> <p>To increase the number of freshly new generated addresses, you have to increase the <code>MinGapLimit</code> json property of your <code>wallet.json</code> file.</p> <ul><li>Go to <code>File/Open/Wallet Folder</code> or navigate into <code>/Home/.walletwasabi/client/Wallets</code> and open your wallet file.</li> <li>Close Wasabi Wallet.</li> <li>Edit the <code>MinGapLimit</code> json property in the wallet file.</li></ul></details><details id="why-do-i-have-to-label-my-address"><summary><a href="#why-do-i-have-to-label-my-address" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why do I have to label my address?</summary> <p>Bitcoin addresses look like cyphertext, they are not easily remembered and it's not clear how they were used previously.
Thus when you do not label all your transactions, then there is no meta-data for you to understand the context of that coin.
When you clearly label a receiving address, then later when spending this coin, you know where it came from.
This helps you to judge weather there are privacy concerns when sending a specific coin to some specific receiver.</p> <p><img src="/ReceiveLabelingRequired.png" alt=""></p></details><details id="how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-address"><summary><a href="#how-can-i-change-the-label-of-my-address" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I change the label of my address?</summary> <p>You can change the label of your receive address in the right click menu by clicking <code>Change Label</code>, then type in the new label.
This is useful for when you have generated a receiving address with a specific label, but then the cause for receiving is no longer present.
Take care with whom you have shared this address, because if you send it to several people, they might all send many coins to the same address.
This is very bad for your privacy because of <a href="/using-wasabi/AddressReuse.html">address reuse</a>, and it confuses you with the labeling of each unique coin.</p> <p><img src="/ReceiveAddressMenu.png" alt=""></p></details><details id="are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address"><summary><a href="#are-there-privacy-concerns-regarding-whom-i-send-my-address" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Are there privacy concerns regarding whom I send my address?</summary> <p>Yes.
Whomever you send your address, he knows that this address, and any coin sent to it, belongs to you.
Thus it is important to have labeled receiving addresses, so that you know which address is for what purpose.
It is important that you avoid sending the same address to several different individuals.
There is a risk that both of them send coins to this same destination, thus unnecessarily linking the payments.</p> <div class="custom-block danger"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>It is especially important to <strong>NEVER</strong> send your extended public key to any third party server.

On TestNet and RegTest Wasabi uses <code>m/84'/0'/0'</code>, and not the standard <code>m/84'/1'/0'</code>.
Due to the CoinJoin implementation, the key depth can be rather large, thus when recovering the gap limit should be elevated to at least 100.</p></details><details id="can-i-generate-a-multi-signature-script"><summary><a href="#can-i-generate-a-multi-signature-script" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Can I generate a multi signature script?</summary> <p>No.</p> <p>Multi signature scripts define that there need to be m-of-n signatures provided in order to spend this UTXO.
For example in a 2-of-3, Alice alone cannot spend the sats, she needs the collaboration of either Bob or Charlie.
In the current way of implementation, a legacy and SegWit v0 multisig address is clearly disdinguishable, there are three public keys and two signatures, and not one single public key and signature.
This means that your anonymity set, the crowd you hide in, gets a lot smaller.
If some one knows that you use a multisig, then they can narrow down their search for your coins.
Thus, multisignatures decrease your privacy, and Wasabi is not implementing tools that degrade your privacy.</p> <p>Yet multisig is a popular feature, and many Wasabikas do request it for extra security, willing to trade-off some privacy.

Electrum can be used to create different types of m-of-n multisig scripts, including with your hardware wallet.</p> <p>Anyway, since Wasabi is using the Hardware Wallet Interface with partially signed Bitcoin transactions, the implementation might come in #twoweeks, check the <a href="/building-wasabi/ToDo.html">ToDo list</a>.
Schnorr key and signature aggregation with MuSig increases the privacy, since only one public key, not n, are committed on the timechain.

Every transaction specifies one or more inputs, the chunk of bitcoin being spent, and one or more outputs, the destination of who receives the bitcoin.
A coin is also called an unspent transaction output UTXO, meaning that this output has not been used as the input of a new transaction - it is yet to be spent.
In order to spend a UTXO, the valid signature and script has to be provided in the transaction.
This ensures that only with knowledge of the correct private key can this coin be sent to a new address.
This chain of links between inputs being spent and outputs being generated is verified by every full node, and stored on the timechain.</p></details><details id="why-is-coin-control-so-important"><summary><a href="#why-is-coin-control-so-important" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why is coin control so important?</summary> <p>Satoshis, the base currency in the Bitcoin network, are fungible units of account.
It's just a number that shows how much value is being transferred, and the number <code>100</code> is &quot;the same&quot; any time the number <code>100</code> is used.
The 9000 sats you spend on stickers are equal to the 9000 sats you spend on coffee.
Just like 1 gram of gold atoms are equal to any other 1 gram of gold atoms.</p> <p>However, the unspent transaction outputs, the coins that hold the satoshi, they are not fungible.
Every UTXO is a unique snowflake that has it's own transaction history, as well as an independent spending condition.
The coin worth 2 bitcoin and locked by Alice's public key is not the same as the UTXO worth 5 bitcoin locked by the 2-of-3 multi signature of Bob, Charlie and David.
So when sending bitcoin, it's important to consider which actual outputs are being sent in the transaction.</p> <p>It might be a problem when Alice sends the coin she received for a months worth of labor, in exchange for a coffee in Bob's store.
Now Bob knows the amount Alice gets paid, and this is none of his business.
Alice can protect herself against this by using a CoinJoin UTXO, because now Bob can not know the previous transactions from Alice.</p></details><details id="how-do-i-set-a-destination-address"><summary><a href="#how-do-i-set-a-destination-address" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How do I set a destination address?</summary> <p>In the <code>Send</code> tab, there is a text box for the <code>Address</code> right under the coin list.

Most of the time this assumption is correct - the amount of an external payment is rarely exactly the same as the value of the sum of coins in the input, thus requiring change.
It does not matter what value the coin has when you send it to yourself, thus there is no change.
But you can use this assumption to your advantage by sending the MAX amount to your external destination, for example for pizza at the tribe gathering.
If the change would be only a small amount, maybe you accept the overpayment as price for your privacy.
If the input is not high enough value for the payment, maybe the receiver accepts a slight underpayment.
You can also use payment rails like Lightning Network to send the small value change privately off-chain.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>When using the MAX button, it looks like you send back to yourself.

Essentially, all nearby nodes are passed your transaction, and those nodes will pass to all of their nearby nodes, etc.
However, if a malicious adversary were to get enough relay nodes in the network, they could pretty easily connect the initial location of a transaction by simply observing from which node the transaction appeared first.
For this reason, broadcasting transaction through your own node may reveal your IP address.</p> <p>So to fix this Wasabi broadcasts your transactions to a random node, and messages that node through TOR, so the node cannot detect your IP address.
When you want to subsequently send another transaction on the network, Wasabi destroys the original TOR bridge and connection to the node and establishes a new TOR bridge and connection with a brand new node.
This reduces the risk of a passive bystander being able to link two transactions together that appear from the same location.</p></details><details id="what-fee-should-i-select"><summary><a href="#what-fee-should-i-select" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What fee should I select?</summary> <p>Wasabi uses the <code>[smartfee](https://bitcointechtalk.com/an-introduction-to-bitcoin-core-fee-estimation-27920880ad0)</code> estimation algorithm provided by bitcoind.
This integrates both data from recent blocks, as well as the local mempool to estimate the current and future demand for blockspace.
The lower the fee is, the longer the estimated wait; and the higher the fee, the faster the confirmation will come.
There are several different confidence levels, each of them gives an educated guess how soon the transaction will confirm.
But the provided time frames are only a rough estimation, and not at all a precise metric.</p> <p><img src="/SendFeeSlider.png" alt=""></p> <p>Because confirmation fee estimation is more an art than a science, you can also set the fee manually.

Since Wasabi is a non-listening node, broadcasting transactions through other P2P nodes over the clearnet would’ve let the peer to link your IP address to the transaction.
This is why we were broadcasting our transactions to our backend server over Tor.
Now, we started tunneling all our P2P traffic through Tor, too:
We did it in a way that we only connect to onion nodes, so end to end encryption is now enforced between us and our peers.
All this without involving any exit node.
We connect to each peer through a different Tor stream.
This enabled us to replace our transaction broadcasting mechanism.

Basically we can continue to operate like now and it is compliant.</p> <p>Here's a great explanation about it:</p> <div data-id="tLOMcU8MhWM" class="ytEmbed" style="background-image:url(https://img.youtube.com/vi/tLOMcU8MhWM/hqdefault.jpg);"><iframe title="YouTube tLOMcU8MhWM" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tLOMcU8MhWM?start=1305&amp;autoplay=1&amp;autohide=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;color=white&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></details><details id="why-aren-t-there-smaller-equal-denomination-outputs-like-0-05-btc"><summary><a href="#why-aren-t-there-smaller-equal-denomination-outputs-like-0-05-btc" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why aren't there smaller equal denomination outputs like 0.05 BTC?</summary> <p>There are many reasons for that.
The most prominent one may be DoS attack issues.
In fact ZeroLink's DoS protection have been designed with 1BTC in mind, not with 0.1BTC, so we may even have to elevate it if someone with sufficient resources would decide to go for DoS attacking Wasabi.</p> <p>Everything in Bitcoin (and life) is about trade offs.
When we build CoinJoin transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain, remember that we always have to pay the miner fees.
Miner fees are not dependent on the value of Bitcoin being transferred, rather, only on the size of the transaction in (v)bytes.
So that means constructing a CoinJoin with 0.1 BTC outputs, with 100 participants, and constructing a CoinJoin with 0.01 BTC Outputs with 100 participants will cost the same in terms of miner fees.</p> <p>So let's dig into the numbers a bit further.
What does it cost (from the miner perspective) to participate in a CoinJoin? Well most users will provide 1 input, and 2 outputs (change + mixed UTXO) and we can calculate the vbytes like so:</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>1 * (68 vbytes) + 2 * (33 vbytes) = 134 vbytes</p></div> <p>But it is important to note that many users provide 2 inputs (UTXOs) or even sometimes 3 or 4, so we should really put a multiplier of 1.5x on the inputs:</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>1.5 * (68 vbytes) + 2 * (33 vbytes) = 168 vbytes</p></div> <p>Excellent, this is the Cost-per-participant of an equal-output CoinJoin.
Now let's consider the variable miner fees in sat/vbyte that we might pay to get the CoinJoin mined within a reasonable time (&lt;24 hours):</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Minimum: 2 sat/vbyte: 336 satoshis per participant
Average: 10 sat/vbyte: 1,680 satoshis per participant
High: 100 sat/vbyte: 16,800 satoshis per participant</p></div> <p>So now let's examine how much (as a percentage) users have to pay for different denominations of equal output coinjoins.
We will take the example of 1 BTC, 0.1 BTC (current setting) and 0.01 BTC (proposed):
First 1 BTC:</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Minimum: 2 sat/vbyte: 336 satoshis per participant (0.000336 %)
Average: 10 sat/vbyte: 1,680 satoshis per participant (0.00168 %)
High: 100 sat/vbyte: 16,800 satoshis per participant (0.0168 %)</p></div> <p>Notice that for such a large amount, the miner, even in extreme cases only takes &lt;0.02% (note this is not 2%!).
Let's observe for 0.1 BTC:</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Minimum: 2 sat/vbyte: 336 satoshis per participant (0.00336 %)
Average: 10 sat/vbyte: 1,680 satoshis per participant (0.0168 %)
High: 100 sat/vbyte: 16,800 satoshis per participant (0.168 %)</p></div> <p>Here, we already observe that in some extreme cases, the miner is earning almost 0.2%!
Recall that Wasabi has a coordinator fee that is capped at 0.3%, so in these extreme cases the total fee paid by the user (you) is closer to 0.5%.
Now we proceed to go to a smaller denominaton, 0.01 BTC:</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Minimum: 2 sat/vbyte: 336 satoshis per participant (0.0336 %)
Average: 10 sat/vbyte: 1,680 satoshis per participant (0.168 %)
High: 100 sat/vbyte: 16,800 satoshis per participant (1.68 %)</p></div> <p>Notice that in the average case, users are regularly paying almost 0.5% for CoinJoining, and only 60% of this is going to the Wasabi Coordinator.
In the extreme case, which simply cannot be overlooked as the network is volatile in terms of daily usage, the miner is earning 5.5x what Wasabi coordinator is charging, and the users are burdened with a 2% fee for CJ!
This is simply ridiculous!
So there you have it! Here is the trade-off with CJ output denominations and why it currently makes sense for 0.1 BTC, but not for much lower.</p></details><details id="what-are-the-fees-for-the-coinjoin"><summary><a href="#what-are-the-fees-for-the-coinjoin" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are the fees for the CoinJoin?</summary> <p>You pay a coordinator fee of 0.003% * anonymity set.
If the anonymity set of a coin is 50 then you pay 0.003% * 50 (=0.15%).
If you set the target anonymity set to 53 then Wasabi will continue mixing until this is reached, so you may end up with an anonymity set of say 60, and you will pay 0.003% * 60 (=0.18%).</p> <p>There are also edge cases where you do not pay the full coordinator fee or where you pay more.
For example if you're the smallest registrant to a round, you will never pay a coordinator fee.
Also when you are remixing and you cannot pay the full coordinator fee with your input, then you only pay as much as you have, but if the change amount leftover would be too small, then that is also added to the coordinator fee.
Currently the minimum change amount to be paid out is 0.7% of the base denomination (~0.1BTC.)</p> <p>It is also possible that you get more back from mixing than you put in.
This happens when network fees go down between the start of the round and its end.
In this case, the difference is split between the active outputs of the mix.</p></details><details id="what-is-the-anonymity-set"><summary><a href="#what-is-the-anonymity-set" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the anonymity set?</summary> <p>The anonymity set is effectively the size of the group you are hiding in.</p> <p>If 3 people take part in a CoinJoin (with equal size inputs) and there are 3 outputs then each of those output coins has an anonymity set of 3.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>0.1 BTC (Alice)       0.1 BTC (Anon set 3)

The possible values of equal output that can be created are 0.1 x 2^n where n is a positive integer.
This is the mathematically most efficient way to get anonymity set for any amount you desire.

Because Alice has sent the clear-text input, and Bob sends the clear-text output.
So, if the two were to be linked, then the coordinator can specifically link the input to the output, meaning that the anonymity set is 1.

This links all the consolidated UTXOs in one transaction, creating only one output, which then clearly controls all these funds.
That said, if you combine less than 1 BTC it is less likely to reveal your pre-CoinJoin transaction history.
The potential issue comes when you spend that coin. Depending on what you do with the coin you might reduce the privacy of the resulting change (if you send half your coin to an exchange for example, as they will know that you own the coin change).
As a result it is best not to recombine ALL your mixed change, though you may wish to recombine some coins if you are planning on hodling for many years as this will reduce the fees required to spend the coins later.</p> <p>If you would like to dive into the details of this topic, you can <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/WasabiWallet/comments/avxbjy/combining_mixed_coins_privacy_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read more here<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and see more here:</p> <div data-id="Tk8-N1kHa4g" class="ytEmbed" style="background-image:url(https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tk8-N1kHa4g/hqdefault.jpg);"><iframe title="YouTube Tk8-N1kHa4g" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tk8-N1kHa4g?&amp;autoplay=1&amp;autohide=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;color=white&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></details><details id="how-can-i-send-my-anonset-coins-to-my-hardware-wallet"><summary><a href="#how-can-i-send-my-anonset-coins-to-my-hardware-wallet" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I send my anonset coins to my hardware wallet?</summary> <p>Most hardware wallets communicate with servers to provide you with your balance.

Note that, this is also true if you merge them in a mix, however that is slightly less problematic, because some blockchain analysis techniques become <a href="https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2017/2017-maurer-trustcom-coinjoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computationally infeasible<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p> <p>It is also important that you do not send different coins to the same receiving address (even if performed as separate transactions) as this will also link the coins together, damaging your privacy.</p> <p>There are two different types of zero link change:</p> <p>When you have a KYC coin with red anonset 1 and you register it for CoinJoin, then you get one anonset 100 green coin and one red anonset 1 change.
This change is very clearly tied to your KYC input coin, but the CoinJoin output is pretty good with anonset 100.
If you combine that red coin with the green, then it's clear that both of them belong to you, and thus the anonset of the output in this transaction becomes the lowest common denominator, in this case anonset 1.</p> <p>When you take a 100 anonset coin, and you register it again for CoinJoin, then you get one coin with anonset 200, and one change with anonset 100.
This change has anonset 100 because it can be linked to the input of the second CoinJoin, but this coin has anonset 100 already.
This change can still reveal premix history which is another CoinJoin, therefore you cannot go further back.
So, it might be ok to send this second change output to some place, or even consolidate it, because it still has anonset.</p> <p>When you consolidate several small change coins in a regular transaction, then every outside observer knows that they belong to the same cluster.
However, you can consolidate within a CoinJoin by simply selecting all these coins in the CoinJoin tab.
Because the Wasabi CoinJoin transaction shuffles inputs, for an outside observer it is not clear which inputs belong to the same Alice.
However, the coordinator gets the input proof of <strong>ALL</strong> the coins that Alice has provided during the input registration phase.
Thus the coordinator knows that this is a consolidation transaction.
It is wise to assume that every one knows what the coordinator knows.
So consolidating in a CoinJoin is better, but it might still reveal the common ownership of the coins.</p> <h4 id="your-options"><a href="#your-options" class="header-anchor">#</a> Your Options</h4> <ul><li>If you do not care about linking the history of the coins because they are all from the same source then you could combine them in a mix (queue all the change from the same source until you reach the minimum input required to mix, currently ~ 0.1 BTC).</li> <li>Mix with <a href="https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joinmarket<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</li> <li>Donate them (e.g. <a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the EFF<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>), you can find a list of organizations that accept bitcoin donations <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Donation-accepting_organizations_and_projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</li> <li>Spend them on something that is not a particular privacy risk (eg. gift cards).</li> <li>Open a lightning channel.</li> <li>The ultimate solution is to 'close the loop' i.e. spend a change coin without merging it with other coins, do not generate it in the first place by sending whole coins.</li></ul></details><details id="how-can-i-mix-large-amounts"><summary><a href="#how-can-i-mix-large-amounts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can I mix large amounts?</summary> <p>Use Unequal Input Mixing and gain fungibility for UTXOs of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, ... bitcoin!</p> <div data-id="3Ezru07J674" class="ytEmbed" style="background-image:url(https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Ezru07J674/hqdefault.jpg);"><iframe title="YouTube 3Ezru07J674" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Ezru07J674?&amp;autoplay=1&amp;autohide=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;color=white&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;encrypted-media;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></details><h2 id="further-questions"><a href="#further-questions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Questions</h2> <details id="what-is-testnet"><summary><a href="#what-is-testnet" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Testnet?</summary> <p>The testnet is an alternative Bitcoin blockchain, to be used for testing.
